# Fashion MNIST Image Classification

>This repo shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating a variety of Convolutional Neural Networks models 
I built to classify images for the Fashion MNIST dataset.It is a dataset of Zalando's article images â€” consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples 
and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The dataset serves as a direct drop-in replacement
for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms

 **---Here's an example how the data looks---**

### Requirements:
* Python 3.6
* Jupyter Notebook

### Get the data:


 >The data is stored in the same format as the original MNIST data
you can clone this GitHub repository; the dataset appears under data/fashion.



`
git clone git@github.com:zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.git
`


## Test-Result:

**Convolution Layer CNN: Trained a deeper CNN classifier with 2 convolution layers, 2 max-pooling layers, 2 dense layers, and 4 dropout layers. Achieved 91.17% accuracy.**
